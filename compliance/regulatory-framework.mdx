# Regulatory Framework

AWO Platform operates within a comprehensive regulatory framework spanning the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. This framework encompasses financial services regulations, central banking requirements, international standards, and regional integration protocols designed to ensure financial stability, consumer protection, and market integrity.

## SADC Regulatory Landscape

<Info>
The SADC region represents one of Africa's most integrated financial markets, with established frameworks for cross-border payments, harmonized banking regulations, and shared compliance standards that facilitate regional economic integration.
