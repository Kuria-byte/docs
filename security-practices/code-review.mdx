# Code Review - Security Best Practices

This guide establishes comprehensive security-focused code review practices for AWO Platform, covering manual review procedures, automated security scanning, and specialized financial application security requirements.

## Security-First Code Review Framework

<Info>
Code review is the primary defense against security vulnerabilities in AWO Platform. Every line of code that handles financial data, user authentication, or sensitive operations must undergo thorough security review before deployment.
</Info>

### Security Review Levels

**Level 1: Automated Security Scanning**
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Automated code vulnerability scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Third-party library vulnerability assessment
- **Secret Detection**: Scanning for exposed credentials and API keys
- **Code Quality**: Security-focused linting and code quality checks

**Level 2: Peer Security Review**
- **Developer Review**: Code review by another developer with security focus
- **Security Checklist**: Mandatory security checklist completion
- **Test Coverage**: Security test coverage verification
- **Documentation Review**: Security implications documentation

**Level 3: Security Team Review**
- **Critical Path Review**: Security team review of authentication, payment, and data handling code
- **Architecture Review**: Security architecture impact assessment
- **Compliance Review**: Regulatory compliance verification
- **Penetration Testing**: Security testing of new features

### Mandatory Security Review Triggers

**Automatic Security Review Required:**
```javascript
// Code patterns that automatically trigger security review
const SECURITY_REVIEW_TRIGGERS = {
  // Authentication and authorization
  authentication: [
    /jwt\.sign/i,
    /passport\./i,
    /bcrypt\./i,
    /crypto\./i,
    /password/i,
    /token/i
  ],
  
  // Data handling
  dataHandling: [
    /encrypt/i,
    /decrypt/i,
    /serialize/i,
    /JSON\.parse/i,
    /eval\(/i,
    /innerHTML/i,
    /dangerouslySetInnerHTML/i
  ],
  
  // Financial operations
  financial: [
    /amount/i,
    /balance/i,
    /transaction/i,
    /payment/i,
    /transfer/i,
    /withdraw/i,
    /deposit/i
  ],
  
  // Database operations
  database: [
    /\$queryRaw/i,
    /\.query\(/i,
    /SELECT.*FROM/i,
    /INSERT.*INTO/i,
    /UPDATE.*SET/i,
    /DELETE.*FROM/i
  ],
  
  // External integrations
  external: [
    /fetch\(/i,
    /axios\./i,
    /request\(/i,
    /\.post\(/i,
    /\.get\(/i,
    /webhook/i
  ],
  
  // File operations
  fileOps: [
    /fs\./i,
    /readFile/i,
    /writeFile/i,
    /upload/i,
    /download/i,
    /multer/i
  ]
};

// Function to check if code changes require security review
function requiresSecurityReview(diff: string): boolean {
  const allPatterns = Object.values(SECURITY_REVIEW_TRIGGERS).flat();
  return allPatterns.some(pattern => pattern.test(diff));
}
```
