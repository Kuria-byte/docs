## Key Platform Components

### 1. DIVA Scoring Engine + RTSM Assessment

<Accordion title="Dual-Engine Financial Assessment System">
Our proprietary scoring system combines **DIVA Score** (Discipline, Income, Velocity, Assets) with **Risk Tolerance Scoring Model (RTSM)** to create intelligent portfolio matching:

- **Discipline (30%)**: Payment consistency, overdraft avoidance, savings regularity
- **Income (25%)**: Stability, growth potential, diversification analysis  
- **Velocity (25%)**: Cash flow timing and transaction efficiency
- **Assets (20%)**: Savings rate, investment balance, net worth growth

**Portfolio Assignment**: Automatic Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum categorization based on combined DIVA + RTSM scores with quarterly mandatory updates.
