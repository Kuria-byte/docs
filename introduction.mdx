## API Design Philosophy

Our APIs are built with these core principles:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Type-Safe Development">
    **End-to-end TypeScript** with shared types across the entire stack. Changes to data models automatically propagate to web, mobile, and backend - eliminating integration bugs.
    
    ```typescript
    // Shared across all applications
    import { CreateChamaRequest, DivaScore } from '@awo/types';
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Financial-First Design">
    **ACID transaction support** for all financial operations. Chama contributions, payouts, and DIVA score updates happen atomically to ensure data consistency.
    
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
      INSERT INTO contributions (...);
      UPDATE chama_balances SET total = total + amount;
      UPDATE user_diva_scores SET last_calculated = NOW();
    COMMIT;
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mobile-Optimized Performance">
    **Efficient data loading** with GraphQL for complex queries, REST for simple operations. Progressive loading and offline support for unreliable network conditions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cultural Sensitivity">
    APIs designed to **respect and enhance** traditional African financial practices. Digital Chamas preserve social dynamics while adding transparency and efficiency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Security by Design">
    **Bank-grade security** with field-level encryption for PII, comprehensive audit logging, and rate limiting. OAuth 2.0 with MFA support.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
