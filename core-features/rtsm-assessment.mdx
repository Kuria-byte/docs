# RTSM Assessment

The Risk Tolerance Scoring Model (RTSM) is AWO's comprehensive risk assessment engine that evaluates user investment preferences, risk capacity, and behavioral patterns to complement DIVA scoring for optimal portfolio assignment and investment recommendations.

## Overview

<Info>
RTSM bridges the gap between financial capacity (DIVA Score) and investment suitability by assessing risk tolerance, investment objectives, and behavioral preferences to ensure portfolio recommendations align with both financial capability and personal comfort levels.
</Info>

**Core Functions:**
- **Risk Tolerance Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of risk appetite
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Investment behavior pattern recognition
- **Timeline Evaluation**: Investment horizon and goal alignment
- **Portfolio Matching**: Risk-appropriate investment recommendations
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Behavioral changes and risk tolerance evolution

## RTSM Framework Structure

### Risk Assessment Dimensions

## Risk Capacity Assessment (40% Weight)

### Financial Ability Analysis

**Objective Metrics:**
- **Net Worth Calculation**: Total assets minus liabilities
- **Liquid Assets Ratio**: Easily accessible funds vs. total investments
- **Income Stability Index**: Consistency and predictability of income
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: Monthly debt obligations vs. monthly income

**Capacity Calculation:**
```typescript
function calculateRiskCapacity(userFinancials: FinancialProfile): number {
  const netWorth = userFinancials.assets - userFinancials.liabilities;
  const liquidityRatio = userFinancials.liquidAssets / userFinancials.totalAssets;
  const incomeStability = calculateIncomeStability(userFinancials.incomeHistory);
  const debtRatio = userFinancials.monthlyDebtPayments / userFinancials.monthlyIncome;
  
  // Higher capacity = ability to take more risk
  let capacityScore = 0;
  
  // Net worth scoring (30% of capacity)
  if (netWorth > 500000) capacityScore += 30;
  else if (netWorth > 100000) capacityScore += 25;
  else if (netWorth > 50000) capacityScore += 20;
  else capacityScore += Math.max(0, netWorth / 5000);
  
  // Liquidity scoring (25% of capacity)
  capacityScore += Math.min(25, liquidityRatio * 50);
  
  // Income stability (25% of capacity)
  capacityScore += incomeStability * 0.25;
  
  // Debt burden (20% of capacity) - lower debt = higher capacity
  capacityScore += Math.max(0, 20 - (debtRatio * 100));
  
  return Math.min(100, capacityScore);
}
```

### Emergency Fund Assessment

**Emergency Fund Adequacy:**
| Emergency Fund Coverage | Risk Capacity Impact | Recommendation |
|------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 6+ months expenses | High capacity (+15 points) | Can afford higher risk |
| 3-6 months expenses | Moderate capacity (+10 points) | Balanced approach suitable |
| 1-3 months expenses | Lower capacity (+5 points) | Conservative recommended |
| &lt;1 month expenses | Restricted capacity (0 points) | Focus on emergency fund first |

class PortfolioRecommendationEngine {
  generateRecommendations(
    divaScore: DivaScore, 
    rtsmAssessment: RTSMAssessment
  ): PortfolioRecommendation {
    
    // Determine base tier from DIVA score
    const baseTier = this.determineTier(divaScore.overallScore);
    
    // Adjust based on RTSM risk profile
    const riskAdjustment = this.calculateRiskAdjustment(
      rtsmAssessment.riskProfile,
      rtsmAssessment.components.riskCapacity.score
    );
    
    // Consider timeline and behavioral factors
    const timelineAdjustment = this.adjustForTimeline(
      rtsmAssessment.components.investmentTimeline
    );
    
    const behavioralAdjustment = this.adjustForBehavior(
      rtsmAssessment.components.behavioralFactors
    );
    
    // Generate final portfolio recommendation
    return this.buildPortfolioRecommendation({
      baseTier,

    const currentRTSM = this.getCurrentRTSM(userId);
    const behaviorDeviation = this.calculateDeviation(
      currentRTSM,
      observedBehavior
    );
    
    // Significant deviation triggers reassessment
    if (behaviorDeviation > 20) {
      return {
        action: 'trigger_reassessment',
        reason: 'Behavior significantly different from stated preferences',
        urgency: 'high'
      };
    }
    
    // Minor adjustments based on observed patterns
    if (behaviorDeviation > 10) {
      return {
        action: 'minor_adjustment',
        adjustments: this.calculateMinorAdjustments(behaviorDeviation),
        urgency: 'medium'
      };
