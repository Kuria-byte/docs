# Markdown & Documentation Standards

This guide covers the markdown conventions, writing style, and documentation standards used across the AWO platform documentation.

## Documentation Philosophy

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="User-Centric" icon="users">
    Write for the user's journey and needs, not internal structure
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scannable" icon="eye">
    Use headings, lists, and visual elements for easy scanning
  </Card>
  <Card title="Actionable" icon="play">
    Provide clear next steps and practical examples
  </Card>
  <Card title="Maintainable" icon="refresh">
    Keep content up-to-date and remove outdated information
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Markdown Syntax Standards

### Headers & Structure

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Header Hierarchy">
    ```markdown
    # Page Title (H1) - Only one per page
    
    ## Major Section (H2) - Main content divisions
    
    ### Subsection (H3) - Sub-topics within sections
    
    #### Detail Level (H4) - Specific points or examples
    
    ##### Rarely Used (H5) - Avoid if possible
    
    ###### Never Use (H6) - Too deep for most documentation
    ```
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Use sentence case for headers: "Getting started" not "Getting Started"
    - Be descriptive: "Setting up authentication" not "Setup"
    - Keep headers concise but informative
    - Don't skip header levels (H2 → H4)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Table of Contents">
    ```markdown
    # Long Document Title
    
    ## Table of Contents
    
    1. [Getting Started](#getting-started)
    2. [Configuration](#configuration)
       - [Basic Setup](#basic-setup)
       - [Advanced Options](#advanced-options)
    3. [Examples](#examples)
    4. [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
    
    ## Getting Started
    
    Content starts here...
    ```
    
    **Auto-generated TOCs (preferred):**
    ```mdx
    <TOC />
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Document Structure">
    ```markdown
    # Document Title
    
    Brief introduction paragraph explaining what this document covers.
    
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Quick Overview" icon="zap">
        What you'll learn in 2-3 sentences
      </Card>
      <Card title="Prerequisites" icon="list">
        What you need before starting
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
    
    ## Main Content Sections
    
    ### Subsection with Examples
    
    Explanation followed by code examples.
    
    ## Next Steps
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="What to do next">
        Clear action items
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    
    ## Related Resources
    
    Links to related documentation.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Text Formatting

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Emphasis & Highlighting">
    ```markdown
    **Bold text** for important terms and UI elements
    *Italic text* for emphasis and foreign terms
    `Inline code` for code snippets, file names, and technical terms
    
    > **Note**: Use notes for important information
    > **Warning**: Use warnings for potential issues
    > **Tip**: Use tips for helpful suggestions
    
    ~~Strike through~~ for deprecated features
    
    <!-- Comments for internal notes -->
    ```
    
    **Examples:**
    - Click the **Save** button to continue
    - The `config.json` file contains your settings
    - Use the *DIVA Score API* to calculate financial health
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Lists & Bullet Points">
    ```markdown
    ## Unordered Lists
    
    - First item
    - Second item
      - Nested item
      - Another nested item
    - Third item
    
    ## Ordered Lists
    
    1. First step
    2. Second step
       1. Sub-step
       2. Another sub-step
    3. Third step
    
    ## Task Lists
    
    - [x] Completed task
    - [ ] Incomplete task
    - [ ] Another task
    ```
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Use parallel structure in lists
    - Keep list items concise
    - Use numbers for sequential steps
    - Use bullets for non-sequential items
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Links & References">
    ```markdown
    ## Internal Links
    [Getting Started](/quickstart)
    [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction)
    
    ## External Links
    [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
    [NestJS Documentation](https://nestjs.com/)

    [diva]: /essentials/diva-score
    
    ## Anchor Links
    [Jump to examples](#examples)
    ```

```

## Writing Style Guide

### Voice & Tone

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Writing Principles">
    **Conversational but Professional**
    - Write as if explaining to a colleague
    - Use "you" to address the reader directly
    - Avoid overly formal or academic language
    
    **Clear and Concise**
    - Use simple, direct sentences
    - Avoid jargon without explanation
    - Break up long paragraphs
    
    **Helpful and Encouraging**
    - Anticipate user questions and concerns
    - Provide context for why something matters
    - Celebrate user progress and achievements
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Examples">
    **✅ Good Examples:**
    ```markdown
    You'll need to configure your API keys before making requests.
    
    Let's start by setting up your development environment.
    
    Once you've completed these steps, you're ready to calculate 
    your first DIVA score!
    ```
    
    **❌ Poor Examples:**
    ```markdown
    API key configuration is required prior to request execution.
    
    The development environment setup process should be initiated.
    
    Upon completion of the aforementioned procedures, DIVA score 
    calculation functionality will be available.
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Technical Terms">
    **Introduce Before Using**
    ```markdown
    The DIVA score (Discipline, Income, Velocity, Assets) measures 
    your financial health. This score helps you understand...
    ```
    
    **Use Consistent Terminology**
    - DIVA Score (not DIVA score or diva score)
    - Chama (not chama or CHAMA)
    - API endpoint (not API call or endpoint)
    
    **Provide Context**
    ```markdown
    We use JWT tokens for authentication. These tokens expire 
    after 24 hours, so you'll need to refresh them regularly.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
