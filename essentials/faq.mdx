## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My DIVA score isn't updating. Why?">
    DIVA scores update based on new transaction data. Here are common reasons for delays:

    **Possible Causes:**

    - **Insufficient Transaction Data**: Need at least 30 days of transaction history
    - **Bank Connection Issues**: Check if bank connection is still active
    - **Processing Delays**: Scores update weekly, not daily
    - **Account Inactive**: No recent transactions to analyze

    **Troubleshooting Steps:**

    1. **Check Bank Connection**: Go to Settings \> Connected Accounts
    2. **Verify Recent Transactions**: Ensure new transactions are being imported
    3. **Manual Refresh**: Try the "Refresh Score" button
    4. **Contact Support**: If issue persists after 48 hours

    **API Debugging:**

    ```bash
    curl -X GET https://api.awo-platform.com/v1/diva-score \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
    ```

    Look for the `lastCalculated` timestamp to see when score was last updated.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bank connection keeps failing. How do I fix this?">
    Bank connection issues can have several causes:

    **Common Issues:**

    - **Incorrect Credentials**: Double-check username and password
    - **Two-Factor Authentication**: Some banks require additional steps
    - **Account Restrictions**: Business accounts may have different requirements
    - **Bank Maintenance**: Temporary service unavailability

    **Troubleshooting Steps:**

    1. **Try Different Browser**: Some banks work better with specific browsers
    2. **Disable Ad Blockers**: They can interfere with bank redirects
    3. **Check Bank Website**: Ensure you can log in directly to your bank
    4. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache and cookies
    5. **Contact Bank**: Some banks require explicit consent for third-party access

    **Supported Banks Status:**
    Check our [status page](https://status.awo-platform.com) for real-time bank API availability.

    **Alternative Solutions:**

    - Manual transaction upload (CSV)
    - Alternative bank account connection
    - Temporary manual DIVA score input
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I'm getting API authentication errors. What's wrong?">
    Authentication errors are usually related to token issues:

    **Common Error Codes:**

    - `AUTH_TOKEN_MISSING`: No token provided in request
    - `AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID`: Token is malformed or fake
    - `AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED`: Token has expired (24-hour lifetime)
    - `AUTH_INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS`: Token lacks required scope

    **Debugging Steps:**

    1. **Check Token Format**: Should be `Bearer <token>`
    2. **Verify Token Validity**: Decode JWT to check expiration
    3. **Refresh Token**: Use refresh token to get new access token
    4. **Check Scopes**: Ensure token has required permissions

    **Token Refresh Example:**

    ```typescript
    async function refreshAuthToken() {
      const response = await fetch('/api/auth/refresh', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ 
          refreshToken: storedRefreshToken 
        })
      });
      
      const { accessToken } = await response.json();
      return accessToken;
    }
    ```

    **Best Practices:**

    - Implement automatic token refresh
    - Handle 401 responses gracefully
    - Store tokens securely
    - Monitor token expiration
    - Use refresh tokens properly
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The mobile app is running slowly. How can I optimize it?">
    Mobile app performance can be affected by several factors:

    **Common Performance Issues:**

    - **Large Image Files**: Unoptimized images slow down loading
    - **Memory Leaks**: Improper cleanup of resources
    - **Excessive API Calls**: Too many network requests
    - **Heavy Computations**: Complex calculations on main thread
    - **Poor List Performance**: Inefficient list rendering

    **Optimization Strategies:**

    1. **Image Optimization**:

       ```typescript
       <OptimizedImage
         uri={imageUrl}
         width={200}
         height={200}
         quality="high"
         placeholder={placeholderUrl}
       />
       ```
    2. **List Virtualization**:

       ```typescript
       <FlatList
         data={transactions}
         renderItem={renderTransaction}
         removeClippedSubviews={true}
         maxToRenderPerBatch={10}
         windowSize={10}
         getItemLayout={getItemLayout}
       />
       ```
    3. **Memoization**:

       ```typescript
       const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
         const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => 
           computeExpensiveValue(data), [data]
         );
         
         return <View>{expensiveValue}</View>;
       });
       ```
    4. **Bundle Analysis**: Use bundle analyzers to identify large dependencies
    5. **Code Splitting**: Load features on-demand
    6. **Background Processing**: Move heavy tasks off main thread
