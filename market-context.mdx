# Market Context

AWO operates within the dynamic SADC financial landscape, addressing critical gaps in women's financial inclusion and investment access across the region.

## SADC Financial Inclusion Landscape

### Regional Overview

The SADC region has achieved significant progress in financial inclusion, with 119 million individuals (77% of adults) now financially included compared to 57% in 2011. However, women are still significantly more financially excluded than men in most SADC member states, with more than half of SADC member states having significant gender gaps on all key financial inclusion indicators.

**SADC Member States:**
- Angola, Botswana, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo
- Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius
- Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa

### Mobile Money Dominance

Africa continued to dominate the global mobile money market in 2024, handling $1.105 trillion in transactions (a 15% increase from 2023) and processing 81.8 billion out of 108.4 billion global transactions. This represents a massive opportunity for AWO to leverage existing digital payment infrastructure.

**Regional Mobile Money Distribution:**
- **East Africa**: 459 million accounts, $649 billion in transactions
- **West Africa**: 485 million accounts, $357 billion in transactions  
- **Central Africa**: 104 million accounts, $83 billion in transactions
- **Southern Africa**: 27 million accounts, $6 billion in transactions

<Info>
Southern Africa's relatively low mobile money adoption compared to other regions indicates significant growth potential for AWO's digital financial services.

## Gender Investment Gap Analysis

### The $12.6 Billion Challenge

The SADC region faces a substantial gender investment gap, with women entrepreneurs and businesses receiving disproportionately limited access to funding and investment opportunities.

**Key Gap Areas:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="SME Funding Access" icon="building">
    Women-led businesses struggle to access growth capital, limiting expansion and job creation potential
  </Card>
  <Card title="Investment Products" icon="chart-line">
    Traditional investment platforms have high minimums and complex processes that exclude many women
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Financial Education" icon="graduation-cap">
    Limited access to financial literacy and investment education tailored for women's needs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Community Support" icon="users">
    Lack of women-focused financial communities and peer support networks
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Economic Impact of Women's Financial Exclusion

Women today dominate African agriculture, the continent's most important sector. When women farmers lack access to financial services, their ability to invest in modern technologies to raise productivity is limited. Similarly, the fashion industry in sub-Saharan Africa is dominated by women, whose small businesses connect a vibrant cotton-textile-garment industry that produces $31 billion annually.

**Sectors Where Women Dominate:**
- Agriculture: Primary sector across SADC
- Fashion & Textiles: $31 billion annual production
- Small-scale retail and services
- Community-based savings groups (Stokvels/Chamas)
