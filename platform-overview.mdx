## Platform Architecture Overview

AWO is built on a modern, scalable technology stack optimized for the African market:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | React Native (Expo) | Cross-platform mobile application |
| **Backend** | Express.js + TypeScript | RESTful API and business logic |
| **Database** | Neon PostgreSQL | All data storage and calculations |
| **Real-time** | Socket.io | Live updates and notifications |
| **Payments** | Flutterwave + Direct APIs | Mobile money and banking integration |
| **Identity** | Smile ID | KYC verification across Africa |

## Core Business Logic

### DIVA Scoring Algorithm
```typescript
// Simplified DIVA calculation structure
interface DivaScore {
  discipline: number;  // 30% - Payment consistency, overdraft avoidance
  income: number;      // 25% - Stability, growth, diversification  
  velocity: number;    // 25% - Cash flow timing, efficiency
  assets: number;      // 20% - Savings rate, investment balance
  overallScore: number; // Weighted combination (0-1000 scale)
}
```

### Portfolio Assignment Logic
- **Bronze Portfolio**: DIVA Score &lt;400 - Basic savings, T-Bills
- **Silver Portfolio**: DIVA Score 400-600 - Index funds, T-Bonds  
- **Gold Portfolio**: DIVA Score 600-800 - Diversified ETFs, limited SME access
- **Platinum Portfolio**: DIVA Score &gt;800 - Full investment access, premium SME debt
