## Core Services Architecture

### 1. DIVA Scoring Engine

**Design Philosophy**: Rule-based calculations using PostgreSQL for complex financial analysis

```typescript
// Simplified service architecture
class DivaScoreService {
  async calculateScore(userId: string): Promise<DivaScore> {
    // Fetch user financial data
    const transactions = await this.transactionRepository.getHistory(userId);
    const accounts = await this.accountRepository.getAccounts(userId);
    
    // Calculate individual components
    const discipline = await this.calculateDiscipline(transactions);
    const income = await this.calculateIncome(transactions);
    const velocity = await this.calculateVelocity(transactions);
    const assets = await this.calculateAssets(accounts, transactions);
    
    // Weighted final score
    const overallScore = (
      discipline * 0.30 +
      income * 0.25 +
      velocity * 0.25 +
      assets * 0.20
    );
    
    return {
      overallScore,
      components: { discipline, income, velocity, assets },
      calculatedAt: new Date(),
      nextUpdateDue: addMonths(new Date(), 3)
    };
  }
}
```

**Performance Optimizations**:
- **Materialized Views**: Pre-computed aggregations for common score calculations
- **Incremental Updates**: Only recalculate when new transaction data available
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis caching for frequently accessed scores
- **Background Processing**: Async score recalculation for better user experience
